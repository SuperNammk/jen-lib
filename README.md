# My Jenkins Shared Library

This repository is created for me to practice & understand how shared libraries work in Jenkins.  
You can get a detailed explanation at: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/

### How to add configurations for Shared Library:

- Goto Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System, then go to "Global Pipeline Libraries" > click "Add" button.
- Type in the name of your choice for this shared library.
- IN "Retrieval Method", choose "Modern SCM" and input your shared library repository.
  
  > If your repository is private, you'll need to fill in your credential/access key.
  
  > You can also use this repository if you want to.

- Click "Save" and your library will be ready to use.

***(This repository is under construction. I'll add more when I feel like it.***
